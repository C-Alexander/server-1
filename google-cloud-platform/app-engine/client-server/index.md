The HelloWorld sample showed you how to create, run, and test
the simplest Dart app on an App Engine development server
on your local machine.
This page shows you how to create, run and test
a client/server application.
Later you'll learn how to deploy it to the cloud.

The client is implemented in HTML and Dart and
runs in a browser.
The server is written solely in Dart and runs
in the App Engine Dart runtime.
As with the HelloWorld example,
the server code is in the `bin` directory.
The client code is in the `web` directory.

The application allows the user to add items to a list.
When the user types in an item, the client sends an
HTTP request to the server, which responds.
The server stores each item in Cloud Datastore so that when the
user revisits the application, the item is still there.
The client and server use JSON-formatted data
to pass the list items back and forth.

## Get the client/server code and run it locally

<ol markdown="1">
  <li markdown="1">
  Get the
  [appengine_samples](https://github.com/dart-lang/appengine_samples)
  from [GitHub](https://github.com/).
  Inside this repo is a `clientserver` directory.
  </li>

  <li markdown="1">
  Within the `clientserver` directory,
  run `pub get` to pull the necessary libraries
  into the client/server project.
  This project has dependencies on appengine, gcloud, memcache,
  along with a few others.
<pre>
$ cd clientserver
$ pub get
</pre>
  </li>

  <li markdown="1">

In one terminal window, run `pub serve` as follows:

<pre>
$ pub serve web --hostname 192.168.59.3 --port 7777
</pre>

Any non-trivial HTML client written in Dart requires a
transformation/compilation step to run.
This step runs all the transformers the project is using.
One of these transformers is the Dart to JavaScript compilation.

The `pub serve` command starts up a server
for your Dart web app.
The pub server is an HTTP server that serves up your client's assets.
The `pub serve` command automatically includes a Dart-to-JavaScript transformer
that compiles your Dart code to JavaScript.
With this, you can change some Dart code,
refresh your client, and immediately see the changes.

For App Engine managed VM apps, `pub serve` needs to listen on
an adapter shared by all docker containers.
In most cases, this will be located at IP 192.168.59.3.
If this address fails, use `ifconfig` (Mac and Linux) or
`ipconfig` (Windows) to determine which IP should be used.
The ifconfig output typically lists the adapter as `vboxnet1`.
The ipconfig output has the heading `VirtualBox Host-Only Ethernet Adapter`.
For more information, see
[boot2docker configuration](https://github.com/boot2docker/boot2docker-cli#configuration).
  </li>

  <li markdown="1">
Add the `DART_PUB_SERVE` environment variable to the app.yaml
file:

<pre>
env_variables:
  DART_PUB_SERVE:  'http://192.168.59.3:7777'
</pre>
  </li>

  <li markdown="1">
Now run the client/server app.
In a different terminal window, run `gcloud` like this:

<aside class="alert alert-warning" markdown="1">
**Note:**
The <b>gcloud preview app run</b> command is deprecated.
Please use the dev_appserver.py script instead.
</aside>

<pre>
$ gcloud preview app run app.yaml
</pre>

  <li markdown="1">
Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/`.
Enter some items in the list.
You should see something like this:

  </li>

## The source files

These are the source files for both the client and the
server applications that you got when you downloaded the appengine_samples.

such the app ID, the latest version identifier,
and URL mappings to request handlers.

</dl>

## Code flow between the client and server

The flow of the client/server app is as follows:

<ol markdown="1">
  <li markdown="1">
  The `main` method spins up an App Engine instance,
  passing in the `requestHandler` callback function.
  </li>

  <li markdown="1">
  The key methods in the server are `requestHandler`, which triages
  the requests, and `handleItems`, which gets items from and sends items
  to the datastore.
  </li>

  <li markdown="1">
  When an HTTP request comes in, the Dart runtime on App Engine invokes
  `requestHandler`, passing in an `HttpRequest` instance.
  </li>

  <li markdown="1">
  Depending on the HTTP request sent by the client,
  the handler either serves the main page displaying any items already in the list,
  adds an item to the list,
  clears the list,
  or displays the items in JSON format.
  </li>

  <li markdown="1">
  In the client, typing in the text field and clicking the button generates
  a `POST` request with the URI path `/items`.
  The handler adds the item to the list saving it to
  Cloud Datastore using the `context.services.db.commit` method.
  The server then sends the response back to the client in
  JSON format so the client can update the UI.
  </li>

  <li markdown="1">
  When the client starts up, it does a `GET` request with
  the URI path `/items`. The server looks up the items in the
  datastore and passes them in JSON format back to the client.
  </li>

  <li markdown="1">
  Using `localhost:8080/clean` clears the list, removing all items
  from the datastore.
  </li>

  <li markdown="1">
  Using `localhost:8080/items` displays the list in JSON format.
  </li>

</ol>

## How the app is served

As mentioned above, the pub server (run using `pub serve`) is required for your Dart app.
The pub server is an HTTP server on localhost that serves
up your client's assets such as images and styles.
In addition to serving static assets, the pub server also produces them
by running transformers.
A transformer converts input assets
(such as Dart files) into output assets (such as JavaScript and HTML).
These output assets arenâ€™t in the file system;
they exist only in the pub server.
The pub server automatically includes a `dart2js` transformer that compiles
Dart code to JavaScript. With this, you can change some Dart code,
refresh the browser, and immediately see the changes.

The App Engine development server uses `pub serve` to get assets
for your Dart App Engine app.

<img src="images/deployment.png" style="display:block;margin: 0 auto;" alt="Interaction of various tools and systems during deployment">

Run `pub build web` manually before deploying, like this:

<pre>
$ pub build web
$ gcloud preview app deploy app.yaml
</pre>

This generates all required resources into a directory as static files,
which can then be deployed to a server.
Note that the `deploy` command can take awhile.

<aside class="alert alert-info" markdown="1">
**Note:**
If you are using custom datastore indices, you also need to specify index.yaml:
<pre>
$ gcloud preview app deploy app.yaml index.yaml
</pre>
