Managed VMs and custom runtimes on Google Cloud Platform are
now available in beta.
You can run Dart as a custom runtime on Managed VMs.
This means that you can use App Engine to host
your Dart application "in the cloud".

For an overview, watch this short video with SÃ¸ren Gjesse.

## About App Engine and Managed VMs

App Engine lets you build and run applications on Google's
infrastructure, providing high performance, load balancing,
security, and other benefits.
Previously, App Engine ran all applications in a secure,
sandboxed environment and supported four programming languages:
Python, Java, Go, and PHP.

Now, in addition to the sandboxed hosting environment,
App Engine supports _Managed VMs_ for hosting your apps.
This VM-based hosting environment offers more flexibility, and
provides more CPU and memory options. In addition, it allows
applications to be written in any programming language,
including Dart.

For general information about App Engine's Managed VMs, refer to
<a href="https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/managed-vms/">
Managed VMs</a>.

## Prerequisite

* You should be familiar with writing HTTP clients and servers in Dart
before working with Dart applications running on Managed VMs.
If you aren't, consider reading
[Writing HTTP Clients & Servers in Dart](https://www.dartlang.org/docs/tutorials/httpserver/)
before getting started here.
