App Engine lets you build and run applications on Google's
infrastructure, providing high performance, load balancing,
security, and other benefits, and runs in a secure sandboxed
environment.

**Note:** App Engine Managed VMs are deprecated and replaced by
the flexible environment.

The App Engine flexible environment
allows you to extend App Engine's standard environment
using Docker containers. For information on the differences
between standard and flexible environments, see
[App Engine Flexible Environment for Users of App Engine Standard
Environment](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/python/flexible-for-standard-users).

See the following docs for more information:

* [Migration from deprecated Managed VMs to Flexible Environment](https://github.com/dart-lang/appengine/wiki/Migration-from-deprecated-Managed-VMs-to-Flexible-Environment)
: Upgrading from App Engine Managed VMs to a flexible environment.

* [Dart support for Google AppEngine](https://github.com/dart-lang/appengine/blob/master/README.md)
: Running Dart server applications on Google App Engine using a flexible
  environment.
